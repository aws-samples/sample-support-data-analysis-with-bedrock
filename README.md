# Sample Support Data Analysis with Bedrock


## What is this?
This is a sample application for educational purposes which processes Amazon Enterprise Support data with Amazon Bedrock.

The sample application, MAKI (Machine Augmented Key Insights), demonstrates how Amazon Bedrock can analyze Amazon Enterprise Support cases and derive insightful information. This repo can be studied and used to build other AWS Enterprise Support data analysis pipelines. This repo is meant as an educational reference and not production code. The implementer of an organization can use MAKI as a reference to build their own application, which should then be reviewed by the necessary oversight teams at the organization.
