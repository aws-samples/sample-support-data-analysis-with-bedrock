"""
MAKI Case Chunking Handler (Legacy/Unused)

This Lambda function was designed for chunking support cases into smaller 
segments for vector storage and retrieval, but is currently not used in 
the active MAKI workflow.

Purpose:
- Originally intended for case chunking and vector storage
- Would have integrated with OpenSearch for vector search capabilities
- Part of earlier MAKI architecture design

Current Status:
- Not actively used in current MAKI workflow
- Placeholder implementation with minimal functionality
- Returns success status without performing operations

Legacy Features:
- LangChain integration for document processing
- OpenSearch vector store integration
- S3 bucket integration for case storage

Environment Variables:
- RAW_CASES: S3 bucket containing raw case data
- VECTOR_STORE_ID: OpenSearch vector store identifier

Note:
This function is maintained for historical reference but is not part of 
the active MAKI processing pipeline. Current MAKI architecture processes 
cases directly through Bedrock without intermediate chunking.
