Throttling limits of an AWS service was reached.
Incidents where workloads encounter AWS service throttling limits, resulting in request rejections, increased latency, or service disruptions that significantly impact production operations. 
These situations typically occur when applications exceed prescribed API request rates, service quotas, or transaction limits, often stemming from insufficient load testing, unexpected traffic spikes, or aggressive scaling events. 
The impact manifests as degraded application performance, failed transactions, increased error rates, or complete service interruption, particularly during peak usage periods or critical business operations. 
Common scenarios include rapid API calls exceeding permitted rates, concurrent request limits being breached, or sustained high-volume operations overwhelming service quotas.
