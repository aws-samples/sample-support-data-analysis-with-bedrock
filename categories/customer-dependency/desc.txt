Issues that stem from external dependencies or integration points within the customer's ecosystem that impact AWS service functionality. 
These cases typically manifest when AWS services attempt to interact with customer-managed resources, systems, or APIs located either on-premises or in external environments. 
The root cause often traces to availability, performance, or configuration problems within the customer's dependent systems rather than AWS services themselves. 
Common scenarios include AWS Lambda functions experiencing timeouts when calling customer endpoints, integration failures between AWS services and external databases, or disruptions in custom applications that rely on customer-hosted components. 
The impact may present as service latency, failed transactions, incomplete data processing, or intermittent connectivity issues.
