Incidents resulting from insufficient or absent monitoring mechanisms where proactive alerts and detection systems could have prevented service disruptions or performance issues. 
These cases typically emerge when customers experience unexpected resource exhaustion, service degradation, or system failures that proper monitoring would have identified in advance.
Common scenarios include storage volumes reaching capacity limits, database connection exhaustion, memory depletion, CPU saturation, or quota limits being approached without warning.
