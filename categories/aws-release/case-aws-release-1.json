            "body": "Hello Sarah,\n\nThank you for contacting AWS Support. My name is James, and I will be assisting you with the ECS Service Discovery issues you're experiencing after the recent platform update.\n\nI understand that after updating to ECS platform version 1.4.1, you are experiencing:\n- Delayed Service Discovery DNS updates (30-60 seconds)\n- Increased task startup times\n- Service-to-service communication failures\n- 25% of customer requests failing\n\nAfter investigating your case and correlating with our internal systems, I can confirm:\n1. This is a known issue with ECS platform version 1.4.1 released on April 7, 2025\n2. Root cause: Regression in Service Discovery integration code\n3. Impact is specific to rapid task scaling events\n4. Engineering team has developed a fix (version 1.4.2)\n\nImmediate Action Plan:\n1. Roll back to platform version 1.4.0:\nbash\naws ecs update-service --cluster prod-microservices \\\n    --service your-service \\\n    --platform-version 1.4.0\n\n\n2. Implement temporary workarounds:\n   - Increase DNS TTL values\n   - Add application-level DNS caching\n\nNext Steps:\n1. Your account has been added to priority update list for version 1.4.2\n2. Expected fix deployment: April 9, 2025, 00:00 UTC\n3. We will notify you when the fix is available in us-east-1\n4. A detailed incident report will be shared\n\nWould you like me to assist with the rollback process to version 1.4.0? Please let me know if you have any questions about the proposed actions.\n\nBest regards,\nJames\nAWS Support",
