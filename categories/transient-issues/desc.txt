Temporary disruptions or intermittent performance anomalies affecting AWS services or customer workloads that resolve autonomously without clear identification of root cause. 
These elusive issues manifest through sporadic service latency, temporary connectivity problems, brief performance degradation, or momentary resource availability concerns. 
The incidents are characterized by their temporary nature and inability to consistently reproduce the problem, making traditional troubleshooting approaches challenging. 
Common patterns include occasional network packet loss, intermittent API response delays, temporary resource availability fluctuations, or brief periods of increased error rates.
