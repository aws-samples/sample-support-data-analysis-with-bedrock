Customer has missed that an automated update has taken place to their managed service.
Issues arising when customers experience unexpected behavior or disruption following automated updates to AWS managed services, often due to insufficient awareness or preparation for scheduled maintenance activities. 
These situations typically surface when automatic version upgrades, security patches, or platform updates occur as part of AWS service management.
Common scenarios include database engine version updates, operating system patches, security maintenance, or underlying platform modifications that may impact application compatibility or performance. 
The impact often manifests through changed service behavior, performance variations, deprecated feature usage, or compatibility issues with customer applications.
