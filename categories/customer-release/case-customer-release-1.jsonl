Our monitoring shows that CPU and memory usage on our container instances have spiked to 100%, and our application is unresponsive.\n\nWe suspect there might be a memory leak or an infinite loop in our new code, but we're not sure how to diagnose this in the ECS environment. Can you please help us investigate and resolve this issue as quickly as possible? Our business is losing money every minute the site is down.\n\nDetails:\n- ECS Cluster: prod-cluster-01\n- Task Definition: ecommerce-app:87\n- Number of affected instances: All 20 in the cluster\n- Region: us-west-2\n\nThank you for your urgent assistance.\n\nRegion: us-west-2\nAWS Region: us-west-2", "SubmittedBy": "Admin-OneClick/emilywood-Isengard (Role) emilywood+prod@techinnovate.com ", "TimeCreated": "2025-05-20T18:45:32.109Z", "AttachmentSet": null, "AccountAlias": "techinnovate-prod"}

I'm David, and I'll be assisting you with your urgent production outage issue.\n\nI understand that you've deployed a new version of your e-commerce application to your ECS cluster, which has resulted in high CPU and memory usage, causing your application to become unresponsive. I appreciate the severity of this situation and will help you investigate and resolve this as quickly as possible.\n\nBased on the information provided, here are some steps we can take to diagnose and address the issue:\n\n1. Roll back to the previous version:\n   - If possible, immediately roll back to the last known stable version of your application to restore service.\n   - You can do this by updating your ECS service to use the previous task definition.\n\n2. Analyze container logs:\n   - Use CloudWatch Logs to examine the logs from your ECS tasks.\n   - Look for error messages, stack traces, or unusual patterns that might indicate the source of the problem.\n\n3. Monitor resource usage:\n   - Use CloudWatch metrics to graph the CPU and memory usage over time.\n   - This can help identify if the issue started immediately after deployment or grew gradually.\n\n4. Review application code:\n   - Focus on the changes made in version 2.5.0.\n   - Look for potential infinite loops, memory leaks, or resource-intensive operations.\n\n5. Use AWS X-Ray:\n   - If your application is instrumented with X-Ray, analyze traces to identify performance bottlenecks or errors.\n\n6. Consider using ECS Exec:\n   - This feature allows you to directly connect to a container for debugging purposes.\n\n7. Analyze ECS service events:\n   - Check the ECS console for any service events that might provide clues about the issue.\n\nPlease provide the following information to help with our investigation:\n\n1. Can you share a sanitized diff of the changes made in version 2.5.0?\n2. Are there any error messages in your application logs?\n3. Have you noticed any specific API calls or database queries that might be causing the issue?\n\nI'm standing by to assist you further. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or have additional information to share.\n\nWe value your feedback. Please share your experience by rating this and other correspondences in the AWS Support Center. You can rate a correspondence by selecting the stars in the top right corner of the correspondence.\n\nBest regards,\nDavid L.\nAmazon Web Services", "SubmittedBy": "Amazon Web Services", "TimeCreated": "2025-05-20T19:12:45.673Z", "AttachmentSet": null, "AccountAlias": "techinnovate-prod"}
