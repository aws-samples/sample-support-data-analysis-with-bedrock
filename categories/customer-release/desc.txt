Issues arising directly from customer-initiated changes, deployments, or releases that adversely affect their systems' functionality or integration with AWS services.
These incidents occur when customers implement code updates, configuration changes, infrastructure modifications, or application deployments that introduce unexpected behavior or failures. 
The impact may surface immediately following the change or manifest gradually as system load increases. 
Common scenarios include deployment of incompatible code versions, incorrect infrastructure-as-code modifications, unintended security policy changes, or misconfigurations in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Issues often involve application performance degradation, authentication failures, resource provisioning errors, or service connectivity problems.
