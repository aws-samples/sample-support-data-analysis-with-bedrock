Incidents directly attributed to degradation, disruption, or impairment of AWS services, infrastructure, or platforms that impact customer workloads.
These events represent situations where AWS service performance or availability deviates from expected behavior due to internal AWS issues rather than customer configurations. 
The impact may range from minor performance degradation to complete service unavailability, potentially affecting single or multiple AWS services across one or more regions.
Such events might manifest as increased API latency, failed resource provisioning, inconsistent service behavior, or broad platform accessibility issues.
